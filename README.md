# Handwritten-Text-Recognition--Framework-Comparison

The project focuses on comparison of different frameworks for Handwritten text recognition. The Handwritten text recognition dataset being overstudied, a clear comparison of the frameworks being used should give us a better idea on how to use concepts of machine learning and what framework to use for recognition of handwritten texts.
